Hello, I'm Warren, a PhD student in the [Theory Group](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/theory/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/)'s [Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/). I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Faith Ellen](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~faith/).

Previously, I obtained my Master's degree at the University of Toronto under the supervision of [Yang Xu](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~yangxu/index.html). My Bachelor's was also obtained at the University of Toronto.

My research interest is in Distributed Computing, particularly fault tolerance and asynchrony.

You can contact me at: [first name] + [last initial] + [at] + cs.toronto.edu

A detailed CV is available upon request.
