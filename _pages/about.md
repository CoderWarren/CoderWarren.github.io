Hello, I'm Warren, a PhD student in the [Theory Group](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/theory/) at the [University of Toronto's Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/). I am very fortunate to be supervised by Faith Ellen.

My research interest is in Distributed Computing, particularly fault tolerance and asynchrony.

Both of my Bachelor's (2023) and Master's (2025, supervised by the excellent [Yang Xu](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~yangxu/index.html)) degrees were obtained at the University of Toronto.

You can contact me at: [first name] + [last initial] + [at] + cs.toronto.edu

A detailed CV is available upon request.
