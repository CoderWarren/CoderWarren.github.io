Hello, I'm Warren, a graduate student at the [University of Toronto's Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/). My MSc was in Computational Linguistics, but my PhD will likely be in Theoretical Computer Science. I have an interest in Distributed Computing and Graph Theory.

Both of my Bachelor's (2023) and Master's (2025, supervised by [Yang Xu](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~yangxu/index.html)) degrees were done at the University of Toronto.

You can contact me at: [first name] + [last initial] + [at] + cs.toronto.edu

A detailed CV is available upon request.
