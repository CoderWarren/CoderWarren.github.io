# Welcome!

This is the repository for my personal website. You can view the website [here](https://coderwarren.github.io/).

The repository itself is a little messy, as many of the files from the [template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) have not yet been removed. As such, it is highly recommended that you view the website rather than investigate the repository itself.
